A test to help understand what the stress plot means

test_switchdetect.cpp - make a surface constructed from two parts
papervectorfield_closest_csv.c - produce a vector field directed towards closest surface point
simpaper2.cpp - grow a flat sheet on the surface
render_stress.c - draw a stress plot

libtiff is the only dependency
